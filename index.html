                    <h3>PHP can do a lot of cool stuff, it's used on about of 80% of the internet. A big chunk of that is Wordpress</h3>
                    <small>Trivia to impress your friends:Facebook is built in PHP</small>

                    <h3>Most importantly (to us) PHP is what makes WordPress work</h3>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Think of WordPress like an automotive factory</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The MySQL database is where the raw materials are kept</li>
                        <li>CSS is where the paint and styling is applied</li>
                        <li>PHP is the robots and workers who put all of the parts together before they go to be painted</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h3>Why do we use PHP and not just straight HTML?</h3>
                    <p>While PHP can be a bit of a pain at first, it also is a huge time saver. One of the simplest examples of this is a navigation area on a website.</p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                      &lt;ul>
                          &lt; li>&lt; a href="./"> Home &lt;/a>/li>
                          &lt; li>&lt; a href="./about"> About&lt;/li>
                          &lt; li>&lt; a href="./cat-pics"> Cat Pictures&lt;/li>
                          &lt; li>&lt; a href="./contact"> Contact&lt;/li>
                      &lt;/ul>
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                    <p>So on a four page website, you would have to dump something like this at the top of every page. And, if you ever wanted to update your navigation, you'd have to go through and manually correct every single page.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Here's the same thing in WordPress</h3>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            &lt;?php wp_nav_menu(); ?>
                        </code>
                        <small>Isn't it pretty? All squeaky clean and nice?</small>
                    </pre>
                    <p>This way if you update your menu in one spot, your changes appear everywhere at once.</p>

                <!--Desktop Server Setup -->
                <section>

                    <h3>Before we can start coding we need to set up our computers for WordPress</h3>
                    <p>WordPress/PHP require more special software to make them "go" than plain HTML does. Usually this software is run on a dedicated web server, but today we're going to run it on our computers directly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>There's a lot of ways to do this, but today we're going to use Desktop Server (also called ServerPress)</h3>
                    <a href="https://serverpress.com/">https://serverpress.com/</a>
                    <p>Go ahead and download the free edition. Run the installation file when you're done.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Let's get this thing fired up!</h3>
                    <p>Go ahead and open desktop server. It's going to ask you if you want to restart the program with permissions, say yes. If you're on a Mac you'll need to enter your computer's root password.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Now you want to start Apache and MySQL services. These are two programs that need to be running in the background in order for WordPress and PHP to work.</p>
                    <p>Go ahead and start web services. And finally create a new development website. When it asks where your site root should go, choose a directory that's easy to navigate to. I reccomend that for today you just use your desktop.</p>
                    <p>Go ahead and click the link that DesktopServer creates to finish your WordPress installation.</p>

                    <h3>Let's dig into some actual coding...</h3>
                    <p>We're not going to start with an actual WordPress file quite yet, instead we're going to use a plain PHP file inside of our WordPress site.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Navigate to your WordPress directory and create a new file called test.php</h3>
                    <p>Paste in this code:</p>
                    <pre>
        <code class="html">
            &lt;html>
             &#60;p>I'm just some plain old HTML &#60;/p>
            &lt;/html>
        </code>
    </pre>
                    <small>Cool thing about PHP: you can just put regular old HTML in your files and everything is cool. <strong>However, you cannot put PHP in your HTML files</strong></small>

                        <p>This is where the class is going to be less about coding, and more about understanding.</p>

                        <p>WordPress is huge. It's has has about 1000 built in functions, and you can always add more of your own. Obviously we can't cover all of them in great detail, so instead we're going to focus on learning how to use the tools that WordPress provides us with to solve problems.</p>
                    </section>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Remember those functions we did earlier?</h3>
                    <p>Well WordPress has a bunch of them already written for you...</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Exercise!</h3>
                    <p>Let's use our first WordPress function!</p>
                    <p>Today we're going to start with one of the most common: wp_nav_menu</p>
                    <p>Let's start by looking at that function on the WordPress codex.</p>
                    <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/" target="_blank"> wp-nav-menu</a>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's break down that function we just used:</h3>
                    <pre>
                       <code>
                           &lt;? php wp_nav_menu (); ?>
                       </code>
                       
                   </pre>
                    <p>So we're opening PHP, writing in our function and then closing PHP.</p>
                    <p>What's up with the parantheses?</p>

                    <p>They're where we put in our arguments in the form of an array.</p>
                    <p>Let's go back to the Codex and look at some arguments that are available for this function.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>So how do arguments work?</h3>
                    <p>Some arguments behave like filters: you use them to narrow data down to a specific category, or type.</p>
                    <p>Other arguments are called booleans. This is computer science nerd for "true or false".</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's go back to our wp_nav_menu function and add an argument</h3>
                    <p>WordPress supports having multiple menus on the site. Let's use an argument to specify a menu called "main".</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Exercise: using arguments with functions</h3>
                </section>


                <section>
                    <h3>Let's go more in depth with the WordPress codex</h3>
                    <p>The codex is like a WordPress developer's handbook, rosetta stone, and bible all in one.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Handbook: It explains the basics of using a WordPress site</li>
                        <li>Rosetta Stone: it helps you make sense of WordPress's developer features like functions.</li>
                        <li>Bible: It also makes ethical arguments about how to code your pages, treat your users, and be a good developer in general.</li>

                    <h3>The WordPress loop</h3>
                    <p>WordPress has its roots as a blogging platform. The Loop is how WordPress displays posts and other dynamic content</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let me be the first to say: the WordPress can be intimidating.</h3>
                    <p>But don't let it get to you!</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Before we start getting into the loop, let's begin with an analogy</h3>
                    <p>Next time you're in your shower, look at your shampoo bottle and read the instructions. Some of them say "lather, rinse, repeat".</p>
                    <p>What would happen if someone would take that literally?</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>The Loop is the "lather, rinse, repeat" of WordPress theme building</h3>
                    <p>WordPress will just keep doing this series of actions until it runs out of shampoo...er I mean posts to do it to.</p>
                    <small>Fun side note: you can create an infinite loop which will give you the "white screen of death". Remember what I said about WordPress safety ?</small>

                    <h3>Let's start with just a basic loop and break down what's going on:</h3>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
                        
 	&lt;h2>
 	&lt;a href="&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?>" 
    title="Link to &lt;?php the_title_attribute(); ?>">
 	&lt;?php the_title(); ?>
 	&lt;/a>
 	&lt;/h2>

 	&lt;div class="entry">
 		&lt;?php the_content(); ?>
 	&lt;/div>

 &lt;?php endwhile; else : ?>

 	&lt;p>&lt;?php _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' ); ?>&lt;/p>

 &lt;?php endif; ?>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <small>I know right?!?</small>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's break this down one piece at a time...</h3>
                    <pre>
                <code>
                     &lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
                </code>
                <p>This starts the Loop, it's saying "if you have some posts, go get them ready, we're going to to something with them</p>
            </pre>
                </section>

                <section>

               </pre>
                    <p>Here's what we're going to do with the posts. Apply these functions to them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the_permalink generates a link to where the post will be stored on a permanent basis</li>
                        <li>the_title_attribute will show the post's title in a clean way(don't worry about what that means right now).</li>
                        <li>the_title displays the post's title as "raw" text</li>
                        <li>the_content displays the post's content, because it's wrapped in the div class "entry" in the loop, the content will be contained in that div when the page loads</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <ul>
                        <li>endwhile tells WordPress that the loop is about to end</li>
                        <li>else tells WordPress what to do if there's no posts</li>
                        <li>endif tells WordPress that the loop is totally done now.</li>

                    <h3>What can we do with the Loop besides display posts?</h3>
                    <p>Well, by filtering posts we can do all sorts of things!</p>
                    <p>The Loop can be used to display a picture gallery, a news section, or any number of things.</p>
